- Yelp Analysis: Jan 2024 - May 2024

This project provides a detailed analysis of Yelp data, focusing on business trends, user interactions, and reviews from 2005 to 2022. By employing machine learning techniques and big data tools, it segments businesses and users to enhance Yelp's recommendation systems. The analysis includes extensive data preparation with Spark, use of visualizations, statistical models, and machine learning methods such as LDA and sentiment analysis. These approaches help identify trends in customer satisfaction and business performance, ultimately offering targeted recommendations for businesses to improve user engagement and satisfaction. The findings suggest that a segmented approach to business categorization can significantly aid in personalizing recommendations, leading to better business strategies and user experiences on Yelp.
